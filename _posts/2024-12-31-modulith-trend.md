On 2024-12-27, I read the InfoQ's The Software Architects' Newsletter December 2024 about "Modular Monolith: Is This the Trend in Software Architecture?" {% cite InfoQ2024 %}.
Before, my company started a new development effort with renewing the entire site of [HUK-Autowelt](https://www.huk-autowelt.de).
We will do the renewal of the site one step after another.
The first step was the renewal of the journey to figure out a car's price of a potential customer who wants to sell her car to us (car buy journey).
For that, we needed to create a new backend application and went for [Spring Modulith](https://spring.io/projects/spring-modulith), one of the options mentioned in the InfoQ newsletter (see: {% cite InfoQ2024 %}).
This article is about our reasons to go for a modular monolith for the new HUK-Autowelt backend and our experiences.
