In the beginning of this year, I was asked to review a German article about how to build up and organize a modern product organisation.
The article is now available at {% cite Schultheiss2023 %}.
In this article, I would like to tell you a little bit more about the development team's side of such a modern product organisation.
How to establish an engineering culture supporting the modern product organization as well as building a team's mindset about that and so on.

## Introduction

> Disclaimer: This article presents my personal opinions and perspectives on engineering culture, development strategy, software architecture, etc.
> So, this is not necessary my company's opinion.

Maybe you have read [that]({% post_url 2022-05-10-building-an-event-driven-microservice-application %}), [that]({% post_url 2022-10-13-with-four-key-metrics-towards-development-excellence %}), or [that]({% post_url 2023-08-04-tales-from-a-startup-and-its-evolving-architecture %}) article already.
Those articles are about the technical perspective on the evolution process of a start-up.
But what is about the engineering culture perspective?
How does a development team have to support a product team in a start-/scale-up?
What should be the mindset of the teamâ€”especially when you co-lead the development team with the product team?
