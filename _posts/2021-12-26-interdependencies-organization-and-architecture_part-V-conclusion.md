As an architect or engineering manager, you are often facing situations where you realize interdependencies between your organization and software architecture.
What team should maintain a specific component within a larger architecture or organization?
How to (re-)structure teams when facing a bigger architecture rework or a new project?
This is part V within a [series of five articles]({% post_url 2021-12-26-interdependencies-organization-and-architecture_part-I-overview %}) (see also: [part IV]({% post_url 2021-12-26-interdependencies-organization-and-architecture_part-IV-team-topologies-approach %})) where we discuss different approaches to describe those interdependencies between organization and software architecture.
In this part, we will summarize and conclude the previous parts about Conway's Law, the Inverse Conway Maneuver, Domain-driven Design (DDD), and the Team Topologies approach.
When an in what situation do the different approaches help?

## Introduction

TODO Describe in short:
 * Conway's Law
 * Inverse Conway Maneuvre
 * Domain-driven Design (DDD)
 * Team Topologies approach

## Limits

## Conclusion

This article is definitely not the first article about the interdependencies of organization and architecture.
In {% cite Wolff2020 %} (it is only available in German), {% cite Ardalis2020 %}, and {% cite Skelton2020 %}, the authors describe the different aspects of interdependencies between an organizational structure and software architecture in terms of the modules and components.

In {% cite Bloomberg2015 %}, Bloomberg summarizes Conway's Law and the Inverse Conway Maneuver in the context of the DevOps movement.
