In the last article about the decision to use a [Modular Monolith]({% post_url 2025-04-06-modulith-trend %}) in a new development endeavor with the team, you may have read already that my team and the company I work at has gone through a massive transformation recently.
In August 2024, the decision has been made that my team and me are not going to develop on [HUK-Autoservice](https://www.huk-autoservice.de) further.
We decided to start a new development endeavor to renew the entire site of [HUK-Autowelt](https://www.huk-autowelt.de).
In the beginning of 2025, we have transferred the domain and all the development of HUK-Autoservice to [pitstop, another subsidiary that HUK has bought before in November 2024](https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/service/huk-coburg-uebernimmt-werkstattkette-pitstop-a-41dc8155-af42-4677-93f4-b664d68065a3).
This radical transformation with a new development endeavor gave us the chance to rethink the development setup.
In this article, I will go through some good and some decisions in the development of HUK-Autoservice in hindsight as eight more or less self-contained short stories.
