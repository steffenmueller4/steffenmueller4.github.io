In this post, I gathered different sources---I think are worth to be gathered---about software architecture. It contains links to YouTube videos, blog posts, articles, books, etc. This post is a snapshot at the time of writing the blog post at 16th of January 2021. Maybe, later I will post an updated post, because I am continously searching for new sources of understanding software architecture.

# Definition and Importance of Software Architecture

## YouTube Videos

* [Martin Fowler's keynote at OSCon 2015 about the "what", the "why", and the "how" of software architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DngAZyWMGR0)
* [Gregor Hohpe's talk at YOW! 2017 about Enterprise Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS0AJLqmnvQ)
* [Stefan Tilkov's talk at GOTO 2019 about "Good Enough" Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzEox3szeRc)

## Articles

* [Justin Miller's GitHub collection about "What is a Software Architect?"](https://github.com/justinamiller/SoftwareArchitect)

## Books

* Clements, Bachmann, Bass, et al.: "Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond", 2010.
* Hohpe: "The Software Architect Elevator – Redefining the Architect's Role in the Digital Enterprise", 2020.
* Richards and Ford: "Fundamentals of software architecture", 2020.
* Ford, Parsons, Kua: "Building Evolutionary Architectures - Support Constant Change", 2017.

# Specific Architecture Topics

## Microservices

### YouTube Videos

* [Martin Fowler's talk at GOTO 2014 about microservices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgdBVIX9ifA)
* [Sam Newman's talk at the GOTO 2019 about "Monolith Decomposition Patterns"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I9GdSQ1bbM)
* [Sam Newman's and Martin Fowler's talk at GOTO 2020 about "When To Use Microservices (And When Not To!)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTdnfD6s5Q)

### Articles

* [Ben Nadel's blog entry about merging microservices back into a monolith](https://www.bennadel.com/blog/3944-why-ive-been-merging-microservices-back-into-the-monolith-at-invision.htm)

### Books

* Newman: "Monolith to Microservices", 2020.

## Conway's Law

Conway's law is roughly about how an organizational structure influences software architecture this particular organization builds. On [Melvin Conway's page about Conway's law](http://www.melconway.com/Home/Conways_Law.html), you can read about that and related articles.

### YouTube Videos

* Only in German: [Eberhard Wolff's video about the interdependencies of the organisational structure of a company and software architecture---why there are interdependencies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Too4oMv3Vkc&t=5s)

## Domain-driven Design

### Books

* Evans: "Domain-Driven Design – Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software", 2005.
