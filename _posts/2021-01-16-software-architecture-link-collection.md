In this post, I gathered different sources---I think are worth to be gathered---about software architecture. It contains links to YouTube videos, blog posts, articles, books, etc. This post is a snapshot at the time of writing the blog post at 16th of January 2021. Maybe, later I will post an updated post, because I am continously searching for new sources of understanding software architecture.

# Definition and Importance of Software Architecture

# Specific Architecture Topics

## Frontend Architecture

### YoutTube Videos

* [Monica Lent's talk at GOTO 2019 about Building Resilient Frontend Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqfbAXCCVwE)

### Articles

* [My article about an architecture to make full use of Server-Side Rendering in the trivago Magazine](https://tech.trivago.com/2020/01/29/trivago-magazines-journey-to-server-side-rendering/)

## Microservices

### YouTube Videos

* [Martin Fowler's talk at GOTO 2014 about microservices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgdBVIX9ifA)
* [Sam Newman's talk at the GOTO 2019 about "Monolith Decomposition Patterns"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I9GdSQ1bbM)

## Conway's Law

Conway's law is roughly about how an organizational structure influences software architecture this particular organization builds. On [Melvin Conway's page about Conway's law](http://www.melconway.com/Home/Conways_Law.html), you can read about that and related articles.

### YouTube Videos

* Only in German: [Eberhard Wolff's video about the interdependencies of the organisational structure of a company and software architecture---why there are interdependencies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Too4oMv3Vkc&t=5s)
